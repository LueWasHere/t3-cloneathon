Of course. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the data for all the models listed in your scripts.

Important Notes on the Data:

Data Accuracy: This information is compiled from the official documentation and pricing pages of each provider as of late 2024. Prices, context windows, and model availability can change frequently.

Pricing: Pricing is standardized to USD per 1 Million Tokens (Mtk) for easier comparison. This is a common industry standard. ($5 / Mtk = $0.005 / 1k tokens).

Context Window (max_token_limit): This is the maximum number of tokens (input + output) the model can handle in a single request. For some models, this can be extended or may have different pricing tiers for larger contexts.

Multimodality (supports_images_input, supports_pdfs_input): This refers to the model's ability to accept non-text data as input.

supports_images_input: Can process and understand images.

supports_pdfs_input: Can natively accept and parse PDF/document files. This often works by extracting text and images, a feature of high-end multimodal models.

Reasoning Enabled: This is a qualitative assessment. It is marked TRUE for models that are considered state-of-the-art or specifically marketed for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks (e.g., flagship models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro).

Inactive / Internal Models: Many models in your list are internal codenames, aliases, deprecated, or not available for public API use. These are clearly marked.
